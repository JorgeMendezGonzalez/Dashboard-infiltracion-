This dashboard is designed to simulate water infiltration using the cylinder method. It offers an interactive approach to simulate infiltration through controls that allow customization of the container size, liquid height, time intervals, and the depth of the infiltrated layer. The dashboard automatically performs infiltration capacity calculations and fits two regression models to the infiltration data. 

It is a valuable tool for interactive teaching, but also serves to conduct infiltration capacity calculations and model fitting after field procedures have been completed.
